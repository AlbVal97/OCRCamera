## Working with ml-kit
In order to recognize text with the library [ml-kit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/android/recognize-text), you have to add firebase to the app.  
The suggested method is the [manually adding](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase).  
It basically consist to register the app to the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) (project name: *OCRCamera*).  
In that new firebase project created add the app (package name: *unipd.se18.ocrcamera*), download the _google-services.json_ and put it in _/path/to/OCRCamera/app/_ directory.
